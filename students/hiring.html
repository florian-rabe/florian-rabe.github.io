<h4>1-2 PhD Positions in the OAF Project</h4>

<p>
The <a href="https://kwarc.info/projects/OAF">Open Archive of Formalizations</a> will provide an open infrastructure to translate and share formalized mathematical knowledge such as theories, definitions, and proofs between mutually incompatible foundations (e.g., set theory, higher-order logic, constructive type theory, etc.), library formats, and library structures. The OAF system will be based on a uniform foundation-independent representation format for libraries, which allows formalizing the logical foundations alongside the libraries and thus acts as framework for aligning libraries.
</p>

<h4>Several Positions in the OpenDreamKit Project</h4>

<p>
The <a href="http://opendreamkit.org/">Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit for the Advancement of Mathematics</a> (OpenDreamKit) will deliver a flexible toolkit enabling research groups to set up Virtual Research Environments, customised to meet the varied needs of research projects in pure mathematics and applications, and supporting the full research life-cycle from exploration, through proof and publication, to archival and sharing of data and code, including popular tools such as LinBox, MPIR, Sage(sagemath.org), GAP, PariGP, LMFDB, and Singular.
</p>

<p>
Within OpenDreamKit, our group will in particular develop a unified framework for mathematical data and computation and apply it to the integration of mathematical libraries and programming environments.<br/>

For example, we would like to hire 1-2 PhD students to
<ul>
<li>survey general principles of programming languages and databases,</li>
<li>extend our <a href="https://svn.kwarc.info/repos/MMT/doc/html/index.html">MMT</a> framework as necessary to represent them elegantly,</li>
<li>apply the resulting framework to the integration of libraries and tools for computational mathematics.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Our Group</h4>

<p>
<a href="https://www.jacobs-university.de/">Jacobs University Bremen</a> is a private, English-speaking research university in Germany.<br/>
The <a href="http://kwarc.info">KWARC group</a> conducts research on the representation and management of formal and informal knowledge in the STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).
</p>

<p>
Our interests cover the whole range from formal to informal knowledge and include
<ul>
<li>logics and foundations of mathematics</li>
<li>formalizing/verifying knowledge</li>
<li>informal and semi-formal documents (specifications, papers, web pages, etc.)</li>
<li>domain-specific applications (spreadsheets, CAD, etc.)</li>
<li>knowledge management (search, user interfaces, system integration, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We build systems that cover these diverse areas uniformly and integrate across domains, languagues, and tools, always combinng logical correctness, wide-range applicability, and large-scale inter-operability.
</p>

<h4>Application Procedure</h4>

<p>
Interested candidates can introduce themselves or ask for further information by email to
  Prof. Michael Kohlhase (m.kohlhaseATjacobs-university.de).<br/>
Applications (including the usual documents) should be directed to the same email address.
