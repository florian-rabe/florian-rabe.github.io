You can find a list of general advice, wisdom, and implicit agreements for my students (and students in general for that matter) <a href="https://svn.kwarc.info/repos/frabe/Teaching/advice_for_students.pdf">here</a>.

<h4>Guided Research (Bachelor) and Master Thesis Topics</h4>

<p>
The best way is to ask me for topics personally to custom-fit topics to students.
In particular, students should contact me directly and early if they are interested in more challenging topics where they can actively contribute to research and that can lead to publications.

You should also check the list of <a href="../Research/students.html">previous theses</a> below to get an impression of the kind of work you can do with me.
