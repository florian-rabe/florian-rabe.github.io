You can find a list of general advice, wisdom, and implicit agreements for my students (and students in general for that matter) <a href="https://svn.kwarc.info/repos/frabe/Teaching/advice_for_students.pdf">here</a>.

<h4>Guided Research (Bachelor) and Master Thesis Topics</h4>

<p>
You can find a list of research topics I'm offering in the area of logics and formal methods <a href="https://trac.kwarc.info/MMT/report/9">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
However, this list is usually outdated and incomplete.
Therefore, the best way is to ask me for topics personally to custom-fit topics to students.
In particular, students should contact me directly and early if they are interested in more challenging topics where they can actively contribute to research and that can lead to publications.
