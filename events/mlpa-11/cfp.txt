-----------------------------------------------------------------------

MLPA'11 is the third International Workshop on Modules and Libraries
for Proof Assistants. Previous meetings were held at CADE 2009 and at
FLoC 2010.

MLPA aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners with
background and experience in module systems from different logic-based
systems, such as theorem provers, proof assistants, and programming
languages. It will provide a fertile venue for the exchange of ideas and
experiences and has the potential to impact the way we organize proofs
and programs in the future.

We want to foster discussion of state-of-the-art results and techniques,
from theory and practice of module systems. This includes but is not limited
to:

* The design of module systems for programming languages and proof
  systems.

* System descriptions of existing module systems, for example ML
  modules, type classes, Coq's, Isabelle's, or Agda's module system.

* The implementation of formal digital libraries.

* Case studies regarding information retrieval, sharing, and
  management of change.

* Experience reports of industrial practitioners, using e.g., HOL,
  PVS, or other proof assistants.

Program Committee:

  * Gerwin Klein, NICTA
  * Dale Miller, INRIA
  * Brigitte Pientka, McGill University
  * Florian Rabe, Jacobs University Bremen (chair)
  * Claudio Sacerdoti Coen, University of Bologna
  * Carsten Schürmann, IT University of Copenhagen (chair)

Submission Categories:

* Category A: Detailed accounts of novel research - up to 15 pages.

* Category B: Abstracts and short descriptions of current work and
  proposed directions - up to 5 pages.

* Category C: System descriptions presenting an implemented tool and
  its features - up to 5 pages.

Shorter papers are welcome. Submission is electronic via easychair.
The submission site is
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mlpa11

Proceedings are published informally and will be available to the
participants at the workshop. Formal post-proceedings will be
considered depending on the number and quality of submissions.

Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at
the workshop. System descriptions should be accompanied with a demo.
