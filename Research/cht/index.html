<h2>Curry-Howard correspondence in categorical logic</h2><p>

In this work, we introduce a generic notion of propositional categorical logic and provide a construction of a proof-theoretic institution out of such a logic, following the Curry-Howard-Tait paradigm. The logics are specified as theories of a meta-logic within the logical framework <a href="http://www.twelf.org">LF</a>.<p>

The <a href="http://www.twelf.org">Twelf</a> files are organized as follows: The specifications are given in .elf files, and [logic].cfg files contain the configurations that can be directly checked with Twelf. They list those files that need to be read to obtain [logic]. For example, for propositional logic, the file prop.cfg lists iprop.cfg and classical.elf because propositional logic arises by adding not-not elimination to intuitionisitic logic.
